			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>The alcohol research and Education Foundation (fare) is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to preventing the hazards of alcohol.

In Australia, alcohol is very dangerous. Since 2001, fare has been working with communities, governments, health professionals and police across the country to stop the harm of alcohol by supporting world leading research, raising public awareness and advocating changes in alcohol policies. And the organization hopes to raise awareness of the enormous impact of alcohol abuse on so many Australians, and there is still a lot of work to be done in advocating evidence-based policy measures to address the harm（Fare，2020）.</p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>FOUNDATION FOR ALCOHOL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION LIMITED organize a lot of meaningful activities, such asthe Alcohol Community Action Project (ACAP). ACAP was a 12 month pilot project which has now concluded.During its trial, ACAP successfully supported concerned community members across NSW community to engage with liquor licensing and planning processes(fare,2020).They have a lots of research on alcohol and they had many campaign relates to that. According to the FARE CEO Caterina Giorgi ,their health campaign would focus on males, particularly those between the ages of 25 and 55 because of results from the survey found men in the ACT were twice as likely as women to consume alcohol at least four times per week(Danielle Meddemmen,2020).Their ideas and actions are also widely recognized, and organizations receive funding and sponsorship to support their conduct which has futher information here:</p>

			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>In order to find my target audience, I used questionnaires and interviews to investigate and summarize, and obtained effective data and conclusions.</p>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>After finding my target audience and user needs, my initial idea is to build a website for volunteers to provide people with a way to register and support projects. Since my users are mainly 19-25-year-old young people, my interface should be concise and clear, with bright colors, a certain sense of beauty and design, which can make people interested in it.</p>
			
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>I want to design a website with pink and purple as the main colors and warm colors as the main emotional communication page. Alcohol has a negative impact on people, and I hope my users can feel warm and happy after opening this website so that they can have the confidence to solve the problem of alcohol.</p>

        <img src="24.png" alt="placeholder image"/width=1000>
			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>After making the decision on the main colors and atmosphere, I began to try to draw some of my favorite web design and structure. I have a lot of design concepts and ideas that need to be further screened and improved.</p>

			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>The next step is to design the low prototype of the website. This is a volunteer website, so you must have about us and news to tell users about the establishment idea of far organization and what they are doing. When users fully understand, they can become volunteers to support the organization and participate in or plan meaningful activities.</p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
			<p>I designed the basic framework and interface structure of this website.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>
      <p>After completing the basic design of the website, I used Photoshop to complete my final model. I added all the elements, colors, and designs that I wanted, and I showed the concept to a large extent.In addition, I also did some update from the wireframes.</p>
